						<br></br>
						
						<p>I am a current sophomore Computer Science student at the University of Pittsburgh. A list of completed classes will be shown below.
						In the Spring of 2019, I will be taking classes to explore the topic of Information Science. The description of the path and courses
						greatly interests me, and if that topic will be an additional or replacement major for me will be something I determine after the next semester.
						I feel that it is important at this stage to make sure that I have pondered every possibility and make sure there is nothing left untouched.
						We all have a unique set of skills and experiences, along with motivations for their career, so I am just in the process of determining what I can see
						myself doing in the future and what course of study would make me the most capable to achieve it.</p>
						
						<p>Because of what I have explained, I am in search of internships, job shadowing experiences, or other programs geared for technology careers. I am in a position
						where I am very curious about what the work experience would be like for a variety of computer science related positions, but have not had the opportunity to see
						what it is truly like. While I am up for the workload associated with internships, I am also in search for unpaid internships, where I can simply get an inside look
						and perhaps advice from a mentor, or job shadowing opportunities for the same reason. If you know of any such opportunities and my resume indicates I may be a good 
						fit, I encourage you to contact me! Your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
